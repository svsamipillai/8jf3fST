## Succeeding
### John T. Reed wrote a brilliant passage about principles in Succeeding:
> “When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don't. What you need is to identify the core principles – generally three to twelve of them – that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.”
